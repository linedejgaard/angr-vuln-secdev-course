# This binary has some functionality that gives angr trouble. Specifically, the way it uses printf (printing pointers)
# in both main() and dump_stack() is not properly handled by angr's printf SimProcedure. If you try to run this
# code without compensating for that, it will hang (because it will error on all states and keep looping while looking
# for a vuln state). So, to compensate for that, we override printf with a simprocedure that does nothing.

# Make a simple security checker that checks for an overflow into the return address. There are several cases:
#
# 1. The return address is unchanged and pointing to an internal angr hook (i.e., __libc_start_main)
# 2. The return address is unchanged and pointing inside the program (normal case)
# 3. The return address has been overflowed, and we can point it outside of the program (we'll check for this)
# 4. The return address has been partially overflowed, and still points inside the program (future work)
